 * Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
 *
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 *
 * Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.
 *
 * For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7.
 *
 * Do this in O(N) time.
